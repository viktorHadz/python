# Student Transitions Survey

A Python script designed to streamline and automate the process of running student transitions surveys. This tool is intended for personal use, helping me, process, and analyze survey data related to student transitions (e.g., admissions, orientation, academic progression, or graduation).

This project was created and is maintained by Viktor Hadzhiyski, as part of ongoing professional development and to demonstrate proficiency in Python programming, data handling, and workflow automation.

## Project Overview

The **Student Transitions Survey** script is tailored to collect and analyze data from students as they move through key educational milestones. By automating survey management and data processing, the script helps institutions identify trends, challenges, and opportunities to improve student experiences.

Typical use cases include:
- Collecting feedback during orientation or onboarding.
- Gathering data on student retention or progression.
- Surveying recent graduates about their transition experiences.

---

## Features

- Command-line interface for launching and managing surveys.
- Flexible configuration for different types of transitions or cohorts.
- Automated data collection and storage (CSV/Excel/database).
- Simple data analysis and reporting (e.g., summary statistics, visualizations).
- Modular codebase for easy extension and customization.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Recommended: [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for dependency management

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/viktorHadz/python.git
cd python
```

(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(If `requirements.txt` does not exist, you can generate one using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.)*

---

## Usage

1. **Configure your survey parameters**  
   Edit the configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml` or within the script) to specify your survey questions, cohort details, and output preferences.

2. **Run the script**

   ```bash
   python student_transitions_survey.py
   ```

   *(Replace `student_transitions_survey.py` with your script's filename.)*

3. **Follow the prompts**  
   The script may guide you through survey setup, data entry, or file selection.

4. **Review results**  
   Output files (e.g., `.csv`, `.xlsx`) and reports will be generated in the designated output directory.

---

## Configuration

You can adjust survey questions, data fields, and output formats via the configuration section of the script or by editing a separate configuration file (see `config.yaml` if provided).

Example configuration options:
- List of survey questions
- Cohort/year/semester information
- Output file paths
